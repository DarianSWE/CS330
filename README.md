# CS330 Mini Golf Scene
This project is a 3D mini golf scene built as the final milestone in my computational graphics course. It demonstrates foundational principles in 3D modeling, texture mapping, lighting, and scene rendering using OpenGL. This README outlines the design and development processes I followed, as well as how this work supports both my academic and career goals.

üõ†Ô∏è Design Philosophy
How do I approach designing software?
I begin by understanding the problem and breaking it into manageable parts. I focus on the user experience, visual impact, and how each component fits into the larger system. I sketch ideas and plan how to represent objects with shapes and textures before touching code.

What new design skills did I develop?
This project helped me craft my skills in scene composition, spatial reasoning, and visual consistency. I learned how to balance creativity with technical constraints, like lighting limitations with a skybox, and to iterate when things didn‚Äôt go as planned.

What design process did I follow?
Conceptualization ‚Äì Brainstormed the mini golf idea and created rough sketches.

Decomposition ‚Äì Broke the scene into smaller parts (e.g., windmill, golf club, ball, ground).

Experimentation ‚Äì Tested how different shapes, colors, and lighting worked together.

Refinement ‚Äì Adjusted object placement, rotation, and textures to improve the final scene.

How can this design approach help in the future?
This process taught me to think visually and systematically, which can be applied to UI/UX design, game development, and even data visualization in future projects or job roles.

üë©‚Äçüíª Development Strategy
How do I approach developing programs?
I use an iterative approach: I plan, build small pieces, test frequently, and refine as I go. I rely on documentation, experimentation, and debugging to make progress when I‚Äôm stuck.

What new strategies did I use?
I used modular development‚Äîbuilding objects one by one and testing their interaction within the scene. I also relied heavily on visual feedback to guide my coding decisions.

How did iteration help?
Iteration was essential. I tried several ways to implement lighting and object placement before settling on what worked best. Each milestone helped me refine the code and polish the final product.

How has my development approach evolved?
I‚Äôve learned to be more patient and resourceful, asking questions, researching, and testing new ideas. Early in the course I was intimidated, but now I feel more confident tackling large visual projects step-by-step.

üå± Future Impact
How can computer science help me reach my goals?
Computer science opens doors to a range of opportunities, from technical roles to creative applications like this one. It empowers me to solve real-world problems and build tools that are functional and engaging.

How do computational graphics support my education?
Learning 3D graphics improved my understanding of coordinate systems, linear algebra, and rendering pipelines‚Äîall critical in higher-level CS courses. It also challenged me to think both logically and creatively.

How do computational graphics support my career?
Professionally, these skills are relevant in game development, AR/VR, simulation design, and any industry involving visual storytelling or interactive applications. Being able to build and understand 3D environments strengthens my versatility as a developer.

Thanks for checking out my project!
